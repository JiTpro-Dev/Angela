    <p>Merry Christmas! I am building this private web page for you so that anytime you are feeling down, all you have to do is come here and find some encouragement. You are an amazing woman! Like I said the other day, those who do not recognize how amazing you are do not deserve you!!! You are loved by so many. You inspire and lift up all of us around you. Never forget that!</p>

    <p>I am working diligently to add pictures to this page but ran into some weird glitches today, so I had to start all over again. The good news is that this Christmas present from me will grow and change as time goes by. I'll create a link for it on your phone and you'll always be one click away from visiting it any time, anywhere!</p>

    <p>Every day I spend with you is a new page in the most beautiful story ever written. Your love fills my heart with peace, joy, and purpose. You are my sunshine, my home, my everything.</p>
    <p>This page is just a small reminder of the immense love I carry for you, today and always. No matter what the world brings, you will always be my forever.</p>
